# ALVRAutoStartService

This is a CONCEPT, unstable, can't even uninstall it with a GUI because I was lazy.

Make sure that you have "Open and close SteamVR with dashboard" enabled in ALVR settings

Uninstalling
Delete `C:\Program Files\ALVRAutoStart` and the ALVRAutoStart shortcut in `shell:startup`

This project is not associated with ALVR
